    {% block description %}Although I have ended up feeling more attracted to python development, a career in game design and development has given me a lot of knowledge that has been useful to me such as: python, data structures, algorithms, c++, c#, operating systems, networking, databases. Finally, any technological career gives you transversal knowledge of computer science.{% endblock %}
