    {% block description %}Without a doubt this master's degree has been a before and after in my knowledge and professional skills. Although I have learned a lot of things like: big data techniques (spark, pandas, etc.), cloud computing, computer vision, iot, etc. What I have learned the most about machine learning and more specifically about deep learning, since I have developed entire projects with neural networks with pytorch and tensorflow, especially I worked with convolutional networks but also with transformers (LLMs).{% endblock %}
