    {% block description %}While almost 9 months I had been working in AI based videogame
    developed with python and unity. I programmed all logical side with python and pygame
    for debug purposes. I developed a server that was in charge of create instances
    of the game (python side) and send it to the client which was developed
    with Unity and C#. The technology used for communcation was sockets using TCP
    protocol to ensure that input from clients were correctly prossesed.{% endblock %}
