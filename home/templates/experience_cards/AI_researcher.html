    {% block description %}From 2023 december I have been working into
    a project based on convolutional neural networks with Pytorch. I have
    designed and implemented a convolutional neural network that performs
    super-resolution and registration of multimodal intersensor satelital images.
    More specifically I have worked with images from Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3. 
    The developed network is composed of 2 modules, one for registration
    and other for super-resolution, this is needed because Sentinel-2 images
    are 15 times bigger than Sentinel-3 images. Both are formed by u-nets, both designed
    and implemented by myself from scratch. More information will be available soon
    on my github.  {% endblock %}
